# PenitentiaryCenter
This proposal describes a web application for the Cochabamba Penitentiary Center, designed to centralize all inmate information in a single, secure system. The goal is to facilitate the work of the Legal, Warden/Security, Medical, Psychology, and Social Work departments, avoiding data dispersion and reducing manual errors.
